Excellent! The scraper is now working correctly and extracting all the data properly. Let me summarize what I've done to fix the error:

## Fixed the Sinta Scraper

I've successfully fixed the error and improved the scraper to properly extract data from the Sinta website. Here's what was done:

### Issues Fixed:
1. **Fixed the `waitUntil` parameter error** - Changed from `networkidle2` to `networkidle` which is the correct value for Playwright
2. **Fixed the `require` error** - Replaced `require('fs')` with proper ES6 imports (`import { readFileSync } from 'fs'`)
3. **Improved data extraction** - Rewrote the scraping functions to use more robust Playwright methods
4. **Enhanced error handling** - Added better error handling and fallback values

### Key Improvements:
1. **Robust Data Extraction**: The scraper now correctly extracts:
   - Author name: "YAN YAN SOFIYAN"
   - Affiliation: "Universitas Sebelas April"
   - Study program: "Sistem Informasi"
   - Sinta ID: "6655767"
   - Expertise areas: Information Systems, Web Based Application, Software Developer
   - Scores and statistics from Scopus and Google Scholar
   - Publication details including titles, links, years, citations, and journals

2. **Better Error Handling**: The scraper now handles missing elements gracefully and provides fallback values

3. **Cache Functionality**: The scraper properly caches results to avoid repeated requests

### How to Run the Scraper:
```bash
node main.js
```

This will:
1. Run the scraper for the author with Sinta ID '6655767'
2. Save the extracted profile data to [profile.json](file:///Users/yysofiyan/Desktop/%20q/project/profile.json)

The scraper is now working correctly and extracting all the relevant information from the Sinta website.
